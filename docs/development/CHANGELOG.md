### P0-T03 — PARTIAL

- Standalone authenticated loopback `pi-knowledge` process/contract skeleton implemented with protocol v1, `capabilities.get`, `workspace.echo`, stable errors, auth, and request/response bounds.
- Focused contract/config tests and build/package entry were added; P0-T04 was not started.
- Automated/static/build execution and real-process acceptance remain outstanding because no GitHub Actions run was produced and the assistant execution container cannot reach GitHub/npm.

### P0-T02 — PASS

- Knowledge Workspace paired-plugin skeleton accepted locally.
- Host-authoritative Project / Workspace / Path and Workspace switching were verified.
- Git worktree scope and existing Files / Terminal / Git / Chat behavior were verified without regression.
- The sole remaining full-suite auth/session failure was reproduced on the P0-T01 baseline and classified as inherited.

### P0-T01 — PASS

- Verified the stable Knowledge integration seams: Workspace Panel + paired backend + existing selected-machine federation + authoritative server Workspace context.
- Corrected the plan to reuse PI WEB plugin/federation infrastructure instead of building custom navigation, gateway, or Fleet routing.
